    "Trained a Random Forest classifier on sensor data, achieving high predictive accuracy for product quality classification.",
    "Engineered a Z‑score anomaly detection module that calculates per‑feature deviations, ranks top contributors, and produces a weighted anomaly score (1–100%) for real‑time outlier identification.",
    "Built a Streamlit dashboard that deploys the model, scales features, visualizes predictions, anomaly scores, and top contributing features for interactive data exploration."
