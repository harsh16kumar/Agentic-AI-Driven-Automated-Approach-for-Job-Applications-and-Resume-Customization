    "Designed and deployed a Random Forest classifier that predicts product quality with 92% accuracy, leveraging StandardScaler for robust feature scaling.",
    "Implemented a Z-score based anomaly detection pipeline that computes per-feature deviations, extracts the top 7 contributing features, and generates a weighted anomaly score (1–100%) to flag high‑risk batches.",
    "Optimized model persistence and data flow by serializing the trained model, scaler, and statistics into pickle files, enabling seamless integration into production pipelines and real‑time anomaly reporting."
