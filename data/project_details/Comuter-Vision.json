    "Designed and deployed a real‑time face‑recognition attendance system leveraging OpenCV and deep‑learning embeddings, reducing check‑in time by 70% and achieving >95% accuracy on a custom dataset of 4+ users.",
    "Engineered a parking‑space detection pipeline that processes high‑resolution traffic footage with YOLOv5 and perspective‑transform heuristics, automatically flagging occupied spots and generating heat‑map analytics for city planners.",
    "Developed an interactive gesture‑control module using MediaPipe hands and OpenCV, enabling hands‑free command execution for the vision suite and enhancing accessibility for users with mobility impairments."
