    "Developed an end‑to‑end ML pipeline leveraging CatBoost to forecast student performance, reducing RMSE by 12 % versus baseline models.",
    "Engineered features through rigorous EDA—handling missing data, encoding categoricals, and creating interaction terms—boosting model F1‑score by 8 %.",
    "Deployed the trained model as a Flask‑based REST API, enabling real‑time predictions for educational stakeholders and accelerating data‑driven decision making."
